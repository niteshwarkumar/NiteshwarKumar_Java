I had one question:
for   
Query: At the end of the process find instruments with largest and lowest net transaction volumes for the day. (net volume is change in positions from start of day positions to end of day positions)

What is the requirement here. should the final instruments of sell and buy both should be shown and how this has to be represented.
The end of the mail says "Expected Output: Expected_EndOfDay_Positions.txt (Output of the process should match with this Expected output)"
Which i have met the criteria. I am little confused about the query above.
